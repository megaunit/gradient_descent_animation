# Gradient Descent Animation
This is an animation video to illustrate the concept of gradient descent (especially for simple linear regression), implemented using ManimCE

None: This is my first Manim project, and I learned a lot of things during the project, so the code might not be the best in terms of organization, consistency, and readability, especially with the unique style of Manim coding.
